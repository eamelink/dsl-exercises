DSL Exercises
===

This is a Scala project that accompanies the Scala Chapter meeting on 24-3-2016.

It contains two packages:
 * `dsl.external`, which serves as an illustration of an external DSL. These can be run using `sbt run`.
 * `dsl.internal`, which contains two exercises. These have no runnable code; uncommenting the exercises and adding code to make the project compile
   again is the goal here.

Setup instructions
---

 * Clone this repository
 * Make sure you can successfully compile it with `sbt`.
